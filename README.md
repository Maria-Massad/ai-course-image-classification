# AI Course Image Classification

## Project Overview
This project is an Artificial Intelligence course project that focuses on comparing different machine learning models for image classification. The objective is to evaluate and analyze the performance of classical machine learning approaches and a neural network model on a multi-class image dataset.

The implemented models include:
- Naive Bayes Classifier  
- Decision Tree Classifier (with hyperparameter tuning)  
- Feedforward Neural Network (MLP)  

The project emphasizes proper data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance comparison.

## Techniques Used
- Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, flattening)
- Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Supervised learning for image classification
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Performance evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - Confusion matrices

## Dataset
- Images organized into class-based folders
- Example classes: Apple, Banana, Orange
- Images resized to 64×64 pixels
- Pixel values normalized to the range [0, 1]
